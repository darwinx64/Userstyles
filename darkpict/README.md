# Darkpict
Dark mode for https://dotpict.net/ and some other goodies, like adblock.

## Note
Dotpict is a very weird site and randomizes CSS classes. They are not randomized on build, which helps, but nonetheless this forces me to use a bunch of hacks in order to theme Dotpict.

This additionally also leaves a lot of untouched classes. Right now I have the bare minimum theming and most pages you see when logged out are consistent. If you see any missing pages, let me know. This theme mostly supports Japanese but I don't actively test it (some selectors rely on localized text.)

Contributing is welcome. Bare in mind how unreadable everything is as I cannot do anything about this due to the aforementioned circumstances

You may notice how there are some insanely big clip-paths. These are for continuous corners which are just slightly smoother than normal roundrects. If you would like to contribute, feel free to generate continuous corners [here](https://onotakehiko.com/clothoid/).

## Known issues
* Mobile is broken (screen overflows)
  This is actually a dotpict bug, not mine, but I will fix this some time
